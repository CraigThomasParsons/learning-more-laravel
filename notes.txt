I think I'm going to scratch all previous plans.
I will decide once I get there but I can just follow
the livewire course and do everything in here.

These days I'm spawning way too many repositories
that are just not being completed.

You created a repository for doing everything here:
 git@github.com:craigpars0061/laravel5.3.git
 https://www.kobo.com/ca/en/ebook/laravel-application-development-cookbook

You also wanted to log everything you are doing here.

You will create another repository and call it laravel-livewire.
Add this in the description.
